# UTF-8-IO
Package UTF_8_IO provides operations to encode Unicode as UTF-8 and write it to a text file, and to read and decode UTF-8 from a text file.

UTF_8 is a test/demo program for UTF_8_IO. It reads a text file using UTF_8_IO.Next_Line, outputs the code point for each character in the result, then outputs the line using UTF_8_IO.Put_Line. It is invoked as

`utf_8 <file>`
